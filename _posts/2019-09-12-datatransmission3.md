In this blog post I will continue with arrays in communicating cross-platform via DLLs. 

<!--more-->
The purpose of this blog series is to understand how to transfer raw data at high speed with direct access using pointers to structures that can be supported by most programming platforms.

## Quick Recap ##
### Records can interpret data in different ways ###
As mentioned in prior sections that pointers are simply numbers that correspond to places in memory and that types associated with that address are the way we interpret the data. In many cases data can be interpreted in the same way. Here is an example of we could define a customer record at a transmitter:


{% highlight pascal %}
type

  {$Z4} //integer enum
  TxRectTypeEnum = (TxRectType_AccountHolder,  TxRectType_CustomerInfo);
  {$Z1}

  TxCustomerInfoRec = Record
    Size: Cardinal;
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;

    UID: TGUID;
    ID: integer;

    Name, 
      Address1, 
      Address2 : String; 
  End;

{% endhighlight %}  

We can interpret the same data received as a pointer in a generic way at the receiver as follows

{% highlight pascal %}
type

  RxCustomerInfoRec = Record
    Size: Cardinal;
    RecType: Integer;

    UID: TGUID;
    ID: integer;

    Name, 
        Address1, 
        Address2 : PChar;
  End;

{% endhighlight %}  

`RecType` can be interpreted as a `Integer` and the `String` can be interpreted as `PChar`. Similarly to the `String` field we could interpret a type of `TArray<Double>` as `PDouble`;

### Someone needs to manage the memory ###

In the scenario described above the sender holds the record that has the `String` type. This type just like dynamic arrays (like `TArray<Double>`) are reference counted types. Referencing the underlying data of these types as either `PChar` for `String`, or `PDouble` for `TArray<Double>` does not increment the reference count. This means that as soon as the dynamic array or string is out of scope the memory is disposed and the pointer is invalid.

*Note:* Dynamic arrays and strings must be kept alive via a reference as long as there is a pointer to their underlying data.
{: .notice}

There are a few ways to manage this. 
* Receiving party allocates memory for the transmitting party to fill with data. The receiving party disposes the memory after it processed it (and at its convenience).
* Transmitting party allocates memory for the receiving party to copy or process completely (no references held). The transmitting party disposes the memory 
* once the send method returns, or 
  * waits to be notified that the receiving party is done with the data, or
  * the receiving party terminates the session

The scenario of allocating memory to be filled is very common in the Windows API, this is often a two-step call. The first call would pass the buffer as `nil` and receive the size that you need to allocate.

In the rest of this discussion I will focus on the easier method of synchronous transmission where I assume data is received and copied or completely processed into other types at the receiver before I return. This way the transmitter can dispose as soon as the method call into the receiver returns


### Abstract types can be used to direct data ###

In section 1 I covered the idea of abstract structured types. The idea was that if we had a record that shared part of its structure with another, we could safely interpret a pointer (memory address) as the smaller abstract of these types (sometimes called a header record). This is the same concept used in Windows messaging where `DEV_BROADCAST_HDR` is essentially the header part of other records such as `DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE` or `DEV_BROADCAST_VOLUME`. The determination of how the memory could be fully interpreted was contained in `dbcv_devicetype`.

{% highlight pascal %}
...
  case LPDeviceBroadcastHeader^.dbch_devicetype of
      DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFACE:
        begin 
          LPBroadcastDeviceIntf := PDEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE(LPDeviceBroadcastHeader);
          LUsbDeviceName := PChar(@LPBroadcastDeviceIntf^.dbcc_name);
      ...
        end;

      DBT_DEVTYP_VOLUME:
        begin
          LPBroadcastVolume := PDEV_BROADCAST_VOLUME(LPDeviceBroadcastHeader);
          // use LPBroadcastVolume.dbcv_unitmask to find volume information
          ...
        end; 
    end; 
...    
{% endhighlight %}  

Our receiver can direct data in the same way:
    * read part of the data, 
    * use the partial data to determine the type and size of memory to read
    * read the data as defined by the underlying type

## Building our API ##

I will create a sample data environment containing Lines, Arcs, PolyLines and GeometryLists. Sender and Receiver records will be able to interpret data in compatible ways, with the Sender responsible for data lifetime

### The Sender's data ###
{% highlight pascal %}

type
{$Z4} //integer enum
  TxRectTypeEnum = (TxRectType_Point,  TxRectType_Line, TxRectType_Arc, TxRectType_Polyline, TxRectType_GeometryList);
{$Z1}
const
  TxRectType_Undefined = TxRectTypeEnum(-1);

Type
  //The base memory block of all parameter recs, also serves as a signal parameter (no data transmitted)
  PTxRec = ^TxRec;
  TxRec = Record
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum; // Integer
  End;

  PointRec = Record   //not transmitted directly, composed type
    X, Y : double;
  End;

  PTxPointRec = ^TxPointRec;
  TxPointRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;

    //Point Specific
    p: PointRec;
  End;

  PTxLineRec = ^TxLineRec;
  TxLineRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;

    //Line Specific
    p1, p2 : PointRec;
  End;

  PTxArcRec = ^TxArcRec;
  TxArcRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;

    // Arc Specific
    p : PointRec;
    CCW: Boolean;   //in Delphi a Boolean has size of Byte
    StartAngle, EndAngle: Double;
  End;


  PTxPolyLineRec = ^TxPolyLineRec;
  TxPolyLineRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;


    // Polyline Specific
    VertexCount: Uint32;
    Vertices : TArray<PointRec>;    // since x can have a valid value of zero, we need a count, we can't use null termination
  End;

  PTxGeometryListRec = ^TxGeometryListRec;
  TxGeometryListRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: TxRectTypeEnum;


    // PolyLineArcRec Specific
    Geometry : TArray<PTxRec>;   // since we have an array of pointers, this array can be null terminated
  End;
{% endhighlight %}  

### The Receiver's data ###
Dynamic arrrays are mapped to pointer types.

{% highlight pascal %}
type
{$Z4} //integer enum
  RxRectTypeEnum = (RxRectType_Point,  RxRectType_Line, RxRectType_Arc, RxRectType_Polyline, RxRectType_GeometryList);
{$Z1}
const
  RxRectType_Undefined = RxRectTypeEnum(-1);
Type

//The base memory block of all parameter recs, also serves as a signal parameter (no data transmitted)

PPRxRec = ^PRxRec; //array of pointers to  RxRec
  PRxRec = ^RxRec;
  RxRec = Record
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum; // Integer
  End;

  PPointRec = ^PointRec;
  PointRec = Record
    X, Y : double;
  End;

  PRxPointRec = ^RxPointRec;
  RxPointRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum;

    //Point Specific
    p: PointRec;
  End;

  PRxLineRec = ^RxLineRec;
  RxLineRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum;

    //Line Specific
    p1, p2 : PointRec;
  End;

  PRxArcRec = ^RxArcRec;
  RxArcRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum;

    // Arc Specific
    p : PointRec;
    CCW: Boolean;   //in Delphi a Boolean has size of Byte
    StartAngle, EndAngle: Double;
  End;

  PRxPolyLineRec = ^RxPolyLineRec;
  RxPolyLineRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum;

    // Polyline Specific
    VertexCount: Uint32;
    Vertices : PPointRec;  
  End;

  PRxGeometryListRec = ^RxGeometryListRec;
  RxGeometryListRec = Record
    // Common header
    Size: Cardinal; //UInt32
    RecType: RxRectTypeEnum;

    // GeometryListRec Specific
    Geometry : PPRxRec;   //  null terminated
  End;
  {% endhighlight %}
  
  ### Receiver's DLL Export ###
  
  procedure SendTxRecord(APTxRec : PTxRec); stdcall;
